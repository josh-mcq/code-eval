This is a project that was created as an example of the use of Python generators for my presentation at PyDX 2015.

It has methods that count "for loops", "helper functions", "if statements", and "number of lines" for a given solution to a Codewars problem.  The idea is to take a stab at the question of, "Can the quality of a coding solution be programmatically determined by these objective criteria?"

For a quick test run, execute the file "combineAll.py", it will evaluate 454 stored solutions and print out the results.
