using with statment will auto close the files.  that's cool.

w+ can open a new file and write to it, and as long as seek(0) it will read even.
if you use w+ to open existing file it will overwrite it.
nothing will appear in the file until you seek(0) or close the file.
if you seek(0) and then write it will overwrite as in insert mode..
 
r+ will open a file that you can then write to, whereas w+ will write over the top of it if it exists.

when calling interactively first import..  from pluggable.countlines import countlines
or just import from pluggable import *,  then call countlines.countlines("solutions/whoIsNext/solutions.txt")   .. this works because we imported the countlines module.  Maybe
